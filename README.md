**My portfolio website**

The website is entirely done from scratch by me.
It was meant as a practice and playground. It is a constant work in progress as I intend to add and change different features as I learn and practice new languages, technologies.

Technologies used so far: CSS, HTML, JavaScript, git and GitHub, elements of PHP to connect the contact form with my email.
I used JavaScript for navigation.
For styling, in order to adopt the modular approach, I decided to used Sass, as it makes the code more manageable and maintainable.

The website is responsive and made with accessibility in mind.
