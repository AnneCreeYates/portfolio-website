**My portfolio website**

The website is entirely done from scratch by me.
It was ment as a practice and playground. It is a constant work in progress as I intend to add and change different features as I learn and practice new languages, techologies and featuires.

Techonlogies used so far: CSS, HTML, JavaScript, git and  GitHub, elements of PHP to connect the contact form with my email (and we'll see what else).
Intended as a vanilla project.
